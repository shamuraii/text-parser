Samsung Web Viewer for Samsung DVR allows authentication bypass and password disclosure

CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk - CVE-2013-3585
Web Viewer for Samsung DVR stores user credentials in plaintext allowing an attacker to parse saved credentials on the user setup webpage.

CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data - CVE-2013-3586
Web Viewer for Samsung DVR contains a vulnerability in its cookie-handling procedure that accepts any input as a valid session ID if placed after SessionID=. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted cookie containing an malicious SessionID to the web server which bypasses authentication and can provide access to internal pages, including camera controls and account settings.

For example:
headers = { "Cookie": "=", "Accept": "text/plain"}

The CVSS score below reflects the authentication bypass attack.

A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to retrieve the device's administrator password, allowing them to directly access the device's configuration web page or system password configuration files.
