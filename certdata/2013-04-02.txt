The TigerText Free Consumer Private Texting App (iOS) sends unencrypted user information in support requests

The TigerText app generates an unencrypted log file containing the TigerText username and password on the device when a user taps on "Contact Customer Support." An email is generated to support that sends the log information with it. This does not impact the TigerText Pro application.

TigerText usernames and passwords may be viewable by TigerText support or others with access to the device or email. A recipient of the email containing the log file could use credentials to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to any non-expired messages.
