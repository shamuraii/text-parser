CS-Cart v3.0.4 configured with PayPal Standard Payments design vulnerability

It has been reported that CS-Cart v3.0.4 configured with PayPal Standard Payments contains a design flaw that allows an attacker to buy items without having to pay for them. The parameter for the merchant's PayPal email address is controlled on the client-side and not verified by the server. This allows an attacker to change the PayPal email address to one the attacker controls allowing the attacker to purchase items on a website but effectively pay themselves instead of the merchant. Manual verification of website orders with the PayPal transactions would need to be performed to detect this fraud.

An attacker can effectively purchase items without paying the merchant for them.
