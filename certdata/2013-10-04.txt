McAfee Managed Agent contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability

CWE-400:Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
McAfee Managed Agent versions 4.5 and 4.6 contain a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. McAfee Managed Agent runs a service on Windows workstations called "McAfee Framework Service" (FrameworkService.exe) which runs an HTTP server on the default TCP port 8081.

By sending a crafted request an attacker can remotely crash the Windows service. This can cause the McAfee software to temporarily stop updating or provide log data until the service is manually restarted.

An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service against the McAfee Managed Agent software.
