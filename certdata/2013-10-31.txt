Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware version 11.0 contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware version 11.0 and possibly earlier versions contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can inject arbitrary script via the vulnerable query string parameter id of the ZeroClipboard.swf file.

For example:
http://www.example.com/tiki/files/ZeroClipboard.swf?id=\"))}catch(e{alert(document.domain);}//&width&height

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.
