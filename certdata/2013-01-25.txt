Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3 contains a stack buffer overrun vulnerability

Foxit Advanced PDF Editor 3, and possibly earlier versions, contains a stack buffer overrun vulnerability that may be exploited by an attacker that is able to successfully reconstruct the security cookie protecting the return address on the stack.

An unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service.
