CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
Thomson Reuters Velocity Analytics Vhayu Analytic Server version 6.94 build 2995 and possibly earlier versions contain a code injection vulnerability. By default, this software package is configured to run with system privileges. A remote unauthenticated attacker can craft a URL that utilizes the software's file import function to upload malicious files or execute arbitrary code.

For example:
http://www.example.com/VhttpdMgr?action=importFile&fileName={BACKDOOR}

A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to upload malicious files or execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
