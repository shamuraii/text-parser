Ruby on Rails Action Pack framework insecurely typecasts YAML and Symbol XML parameters

The Ruby on Rails advisory states:

"Multiple vulnerabilities in parameter parsing in Action Pack

There are multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code for Ruby on Rails which allows attackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a Rails application. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0156.

Versions Affected: ALL versions
Not affected: NONE
Fixed Versions: 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, 2.3.15

Impact
------
The parameter parsing code of Ruby on Rails allows applications to automatically cast values from strings to certain data types. Unfortunately the type casting code supported certain conversions which were not suitable for performing on user-provided data including creating Symbols and parsing YAML. These unsuitable conversions can be used by an attacker to compromise a Rails application.

Due to the critical nature of this vulnerability, and the fact that portions of it have been disclosed publicly, all users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds *immediately*.

Releases
--------
The 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19 and 2.3.15 releases are available at the normal locations."

Additional details are available in the full advisory. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.

A Ruby on Rails application that uses Action Pack is susceptible to authentication bypass, SQL injection, arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
